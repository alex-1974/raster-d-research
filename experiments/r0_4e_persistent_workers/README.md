Nothing in this experiment directory is a stable public API.

## 1. Purpose

R0.4e researches persistent worker reuse for the bounded staged raster
execution model established by R0.4d.

The central separation is:

```text
semantic work
!=
stage readiness
!=
worker assignment
!=
worker lifetime
!=
request lifetime
```

R0.4e-0 defines only vocabulary and verifies historical-reference reuse.

It does not create worker threads.

## 2. Historical evidence boundary

R0.4e must not modify:

```text
source/raster/
experiments/r0_3_regions_streaming/
experiments/r0_4a_synchronous_execution/
experiments/r0_4b_bounded_parallel_execution/
experiments/r0_4c_scheduling_policy/
experiments/r0_4d_pipeline_backpressure/
```

Those sources are immutable evidence for this research slice.

R0.4e may compile and call selected historical research modules.

## 3. Worker vocabulary

R0.4e-0 distinguishes two persistent raster-stage roles:

```text
materialization
compute
```

The first candidate worker lifecycle is:

```text
notStarted
running
waiting
shutdownObserved
joined
```

These names are research vocabulary only.

R0.4e-0 defines no worker-loop transition function.

## 4. Identity boundary

Worker identity and request identity are distinct:

```text
StableWorkerIdentity
StableRequestIdentity
```

A persistent worker may outlive and later serve more than one request.

Therefore:

```text
worker identity
!=
request identity
!=
work-unit identity
```

R0.4e-0 does not yet execute multiple requests.

## 5. Stage-queue vocabulary

The first candidate stage queues are:

```text
materialization queue
compute queue
```

R0.4e-0 defines only explicit finite queue-capacity vocabulary:

```text
materializationQueueCapacity
computeQueueCapacity
```

It does not implement a queue.

Queue bounds do not replace the existing R0.4d execution bounds.

## 6. R0.4e-0 reuse objective

The first executable slice proves only that the new experiment can:

1. compile the persistent-worker vocabulary;
2. compile and call the immutable R0.4a synchronous reference;
3. compile and call the immutable R0.4b bounded-parallel reference;
4. compile and call the immutable R0.4c FIFO policy oracle;
5. compile and exercise the immutable R0.4d pipeline state machine;
6. preserve exact R0.4a/R0.4b output and coverage equality;
7. preserve deterministic R0.4c FIFO order;
8. complete one imported R0.4d state-machine lifecycle with final zero active
   and handoff state.

R0.4e-0 does not prove persistent execution.

## 7. Explicit exclusions

R0.4e-0 contains no:

```text
core.thread.Thread
Barrier
Mutex
Condition
Semaphore
worker loop
queue implementation
work stealing
prefetch
timer
sleep
timeout
```

Persistent-thread behaviour belongs to R0.4e-1.

Bounded queue behaviour belongs to R0.4e-2.

## 9. R0.4e evidence slices

### R0.4e-0 — worker vocabulary and reuse boundary

Define worker/request/queue vocabulary and compile historical references.

### R0.4e-1 — persistent worker loop

Prove one persistent worker blocks, wakes, executes multiple jobs, returns to
waiting and shuts down cleanly.

### R0.4e-2 — bounded stage queues

Prove finite queue capacity, deterministic order, queue-full behaviour and
close/wakeup semantics.

### R0.4e-3 — real raster pipeline on persistent workers

Run exact R0.4d staged raster work on persistent workers.

### R0.4e-4 — sequential request reuse

Reuse the same live worker set for multiple successful sequential requests.

### R0.4e-5 — termination recovery

Terminate one request, clean it up and prove a later request succeeds on the
same worker set.

### R0.4e-6 — shutdown and final integration

Wake, stop and join all persistent workers and compare final raster semantics
against historical references.

## 10. Promotion rule

Passing any R0.4e slice does not automatically authorize a public WorkerPool,
Worker, Task, Queue, Executor, Future or ThreadPool API.

## 11. R0.4e-0 result

R0.4e-0 is complete.

It established research-local vocabulary for:

```text
worker role
worker lifecycle
worker identity
request identity
stage-queue kind
stage-queue capacity
```

and compiled/called the immutable R0.4a/R0.4b/R0.4c/R0.4d references.

The R0.4a and R0.4b output/coverage remained exact-equal.

The R0.4c FIFO oracle retained deterministic order.

The imported R0.4d state machine completed one full lifecycle and returned
active/handoff accounting to zero.

No worker thread or queue was introduced.

## 12. R0.4e-1 persistent worker loop

R0.4e-1 introduces exactly one persistent OS worker thread.

The proof sequence is:

```text
thread start
    ->
waiting
    ->
job 101
    ->
waiting
    ->
job 202
    ->
waiting
    ->
shutdown observed
    ->
thread return
    ->
join
```

The worker thread is created exactly once.

Both jobs execute inside the same invocation of the persistent worker loop.

The test records:

```text
runEntries
waitEntries
jobsExecuted
executionTrace
shutdownObserved
```

and requires:

```text
runEntries == 1
jobsExecuted == 2
executionTrace == [101, 202]
```

The worker uses three reusable explicit synchronization gates:

- a waiting gate so the coordinator knows the worker reached the waiting state;
- a command gate that releases exactly one pending command;
- a completion gate that reports one command boundary.

These are deterministic research gates.

R0.4e-1 does not implement a stage queue.

No sleep, timeout, polling loop or wall-clock threshold is used.

After shutdown the coordinator joins the one worker thread and records the
final lifecycle state as:

```text
joined
```

R0.4e-1 proves persistent thread reuse only.

Queue bounds and queue-full semantics remain R0.4e-2.

## 13. R0.4e-1 result

R0.4e-1 is complete.

Exactly one OS worker thread was created and started once.

The same persistent `run()` invocation executed:

```text
job 101
job 202
```

with deterministic waiting boundaries between them.

The final evidence was:

```text
runEntries   = 1
waitEntries  = 3
jobsExecuted = 2
trace        = [101, 202]
```

Cooperative shutdown was observed by the same worker and the thread was joined.

No queue, sleep, timeout or polling correctness assumption was introduced.

## 14. R0.4e-2 bounded stage mailboxes

R0.4e-2 introduces two research-local stage-mailbox identities:

```text
materialization
compute
```

The mailbox contract is deliberately smaller than a production queue API.

### 14.1 Push semantics

`tryPush` is non-blocking and returns one of:

```text
none
full
closed
```

Therefore queue-capacity pressure is explicit:

```text
count == capacity
    ->
tryPush == full
```

A rejected full push does not mutate queue contents.

### 14.2 FIFO semantics

Accepted items are removed in insertion order.

The baseline uses stable research work identity and ready ordinal only as
evidence payload.

R0.4e-2 does not reopen R0.4c priority/fairness policy.

### 14.3 Blocking pop

`waitPop` blocks while:

```text
queue empty
and
queue open
```

It wakes when either:

- one item is pushed; or
- the mailbox is closed.

The proof uses a condition variable plus an explicit barrier observation hook so
the coordinator knows the consumer has reached the wait boundary before
triggering the wakeup.

No elapsed-time threshold is used.

### 14.4 Close semantics

`close` means:

```text
reject later pushes
allow already queued items to drain
wake blocked consumers
after drain, waitPop returns closed
```

Closing an already closed mailbox is idempotent.

Mailbox close is not request cancellation.

R0.4d request termination rules remain separate and will be reintroduced with
real persistent raster workers in later slices.

### 14.5 Bounded evidence

The materialization-mailbox fixture uses capacity two and proves:

```text
peakCount == 2
third push while full -> full
pop oldest
push resumes
FIFO trace == [10, 20, 30]
```

The compute-mailbox fixture uses capacity one and one consumer thread to prove:

```text
empty/open -> consumer blocks
push 55 -> consumer wakes with item 55
empty/open -> consumer blocks again
close -> consumer wakes with closed
```

No stage queue grows beyond configured capacity.

R0.4e-2 still does not execute the raster pipeline.

That begins in R0.4e-3.



## 15. R0.4e-3 persistent raster pipeline

R0.4e-3 combines the already-proven persistent-worker and bounded-mailbox
mechanics with real staged raster work.

The first integration candidate uses exactly:

```text
one persistent materialization worker
one persistent compute worker
one capacity-one materialization mailbox
one capacity-one compute mailbox
```

Both worker threads are created and started once for the request and execute all
six canonical raster work units without per-work-unit thread creation.

The real raster mechanics are imported unchanged from the immutable R0.4d
fixture:

```text
dependency preparation
procedural materialization
logical-to-resident mapping
weighted 3x3 neighbourhood compute
task-output commit
resident release
```

The e3 correctness gate requires exact equality with the immutable R0.4a
synchronous reference:

```text
persistent output
==
synchronous output

persistent completed coverage
==
synchronous completed coverage
```

R0.4e-3 also records that each persistent stage worker enters its `run()`
exactly once while executing all work units, both stage-mailbox peaks remain
within their configured finite capacity, final retained raster bytes return to
zero and both workers are joined.

R0.4e-3 intentionally proves only one successful request.

Cross-request reuse remains R0.4e-4.

Failure/cancellation recovery remains R0.4e-5.

No public worker/executor API is promoted.


## 16. R0.4e-4 sequential request reuse

R0.4e-4 keeps exactly one live materialization worker and one live compute
worker across two successful sequential raster requests.

The two requests deliberately use different:

```text
StableRequestIdentity
requested output region
work-unit decomposition
work-unit count
output length
```

The same worker threads are created and started once before request 1 and are
shut down only after request 2.

The e4 gate requires:

```text
materialization worker runEntries == 1
compute worker runEntries == 1

materialization jobs
==
request 1 work units + request 2 work units

compute jobs
==
request 1 work units + request 2 work units
```

Each worker also records the request identity observed for every work unit so
the experiment can prove that both requests crossed the same persistent worker
set.

For each request independently:

```text
persistent output
==
R0.4a synchronous output

persistent completed coverage
==
R0.4a synchronous completed coverage
```

The request-local slot is reset between requests. The second request therefore
starts with fresh output, coverage, fixture and completion state while worker
identity and worker lifetime remain unchanged.

The first request's copied output/coverage is verified again after request 2 to
detect accidental cross-request mutation.

After both requests, both bounded mailboxes are closed, drained and empty, and
both persistent workers are joined.

R0.4e-4 does not introduce failure or cancellation recovery.

That remains R0.4e-5.


## 17. R0.4e-5 failure/cancellation recovery

R0.4e-5 adds controlled request termination while keeping the persistent worker
set alive.

Two termination classes are exercised independently:

```text
cooperative cancellation before a later work unit begins
controlled materialization failure for one work unit
```

The cancellation fixture completes an initial prefix, observes cancellation at
the next work-unit boundary, admits no later work for that request, cleans all
request-local retained raster state and then executes a later request
successfully on the same worker threads.

The failure fixture injects one deterministic materialization failure after a
completed prefix. The failed request is terminated and all retained raster state
is released. A later request then executes successfully on the same still-live
worker pair.

For each recovery request:

```text
persistent output
==
R0.4a synchronous output

persistent completed coverage
==
R0.4a synchronous completed coverage
```

The persistent worker `run()` entry count must remain exactly one for each
worker across termination and recovery.

R0.4e-5 is still research-local. It does not define a public cancellation,
error, worker or executor API.

Final worker-set shutdown and the complete R0.4e success-gate integration remain
R0.4e-6.


## 18. R0.4e-6 shutdown and final integration

R0.4e-6 closes the remaining worker-set lifecycle gates.

One persistent worker is deterministically observed while blocked on an
empty/open bounded mailbox. Closing that mailbox must:

```text
wake the blocked worker
produce closed from waitPop
transition the worker to shutdownObserved
allow the thread to return
allow the coordinator to join it
transition observer state to joined
```

After shutdown, producer admission is permanently closed:

```text
tryPush -> closed
```

and the worker's started/completed job counters remain unchanged. This is the
explicit proof that no work starts after worker-set shutdown.

The final integration slice also rechecks the canonical raster result against
the immutable R0.4a synchronous and R0.4b bounded-parallel references and
requires exact output/coverage equality plus zero final retained raster bytes.

### 18.1 R0.4e candidate success gate mapping

The full R0.4e evidence now maps to the 16 candidate gates as follows:

```text
1  worker lifetime distinct from request/work-unit lifetime
   -> e0/e1/e4

2  worker threads created once and reused
   -> e1/e3

3  same worker set reused across sequential requests
   -> e4

4  stage queues explicitly bounded
   -> e2/e3/e4/e5

5  stable deterministic FIFO identity/order
   -> e2

6  no correctness claim depends on sleep/timeout/wallclock
   -> e1/e2/e3/e4/e5/e6

7  exact raster output/coverage matches semantic references
   -> e0/e3/e4/e5/e6

8  request-local termination prevents later starts
   -> e5

9  already-running work remains non-preemptive
   -> inherited R0.4b/R0.4d semantics; e5 terminates only at controlled boundaries

10 termination cleanup returns resident state to zero
   -> e5

11 failed/cancelled request does not poison next request
   -> e5

12 clean shutdown wakes and joins persistent workers
   -> e1/e3/e4/e5/e6

13 no work starts after worker-set shutdown
   -> e6

14 no work stealing/prefetch/source policy introduced
   -> all R0.4e slices

15 historical evidence and production source/raster unchanged
   -> branch compare scope

16 DMD and LDC deterministic correctness equal
   -> local compiler gates for e0-e6
```

R0.4e-6 does not promote any public worker, queue, task, future, executor or
thread-pool API.

The final local DMD/LDC validation remains the release gate for declaring
R0.4e complete.


## 19. Final local validation

Final local compiler evidence for R0.4e-6:

```text
DMD: 19 modules passed unittests
LDC: 19 modules passed unittests

dmd=0
ldc=0
working tree clean
```

Final branch scope against `main` contains only:

```text
docs/research/execution.md
experiments/r0_4e_persistent_workers/
```

No production file under `source/raster/` was changed.

All 16 candidate R0.4e success gates are therefore covered by the accumulated
evidence from e0 through e6.

R0.4e is complete as research evidence.

No public worker, queue, task, future, executor or thread-pool API is promoted
by this result.
