    Diagnostic result for the bounded E3.1.3 decomposition oracle.

/++
    Deliberate upper bound for the bitmap-backed research oracle.

    Large-coordinate correctness is tested separately by E3.1.1 and E3.1.2.

/++
    Validates that `members` form an exact non-overlapping pixel decomposition
    of `target`.

    Successful decomposition means:

    - every non-empty member is contained in `target`;
    - no target pixel is covered more than once;
    - every target pixel is covered exactly once;
    - no non-empty member produces pixels outside `target`.

    Empty members contribute no coverage. They may be anchored anywhere, but
    their own Region2D geometry must remain representable.

    The bitmap implementation is intentionally limited to
    `MAX_ORACLE_PIXELS`. Exceeding that bound is an oracle-capacity condition,
    not invalid target geometry.
